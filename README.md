Thankful
========

*Reward the creators of content and software according to your preferences. Be thankful.*

Thankful is a program that takes data about which websites you visit, which music you listen to, which videos you watch, which applications you use (such as Thankful itself), and then presents it to you and allows you to distribute a charitable sum of your choice to those creators you think are deserving.

By using Thankful, you incentivize people to want you to like what they are doing, instead of exploiting or distracting you (such as advertising, sponsored content and data collection).

Thankful is a planned project of the ActivityWatch team, it is our hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have more sane incentives in society.

## Features

 - Supports data from ActivityWatch.
 - Reward content primarily to creators, not platforms.
 - Payments are done using cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin), allowing for both anonymous and provable donations.
 - As a way to incentivize creators to be transparent about the donations they have received, a list of top creators could be generated.

## What content could be funded by Thankful?

 - Videos (from web/YouTube/Vimeo history)
 - Music (from Spotify/Soundcloud history)
 - Writing (from web history)
 - Software (from application usage)
   - How the development of free software should be funded has been a problem for a long time (See [this article](https://fosspost.org/opinions/people-be-thankful-for-free-software-developers))
   - We could even fund development of the software dependencies by doing dependency analysis. Preferably the software creator would indicate which dependencies are important enough to receive a part of the funds.

## How do creators join?

This is an issue where we have yet to decide on a solution, we don't want centralized control, because we shouldn't need it and we have no interest in making a inferior solution just to make some money ourselves. We can not afford to make compromises in succeeding.

Some options are:

 - Website owners put a special tag in place which provides a cryptocurrency address for receiving donations.
 - Content creators on platforms are identified automatically and looked up in a database.
 - Users of Thankful can themselves provide a donation method when one is not automatically detected.

## Uses

 - Anyone can become a creator.
 - By being able to prove your charity you can prove your goodwill.

## What does it cost?

Zero, zip, nothing, nil. We will try to make Thankful as good as possible and hope that people will be thankful for that and reward us accordingly. In essence, we want to prove that it works by funding ourselves with it.

## Thank you

 - Flattr and Flattr Plus, for bringing some good ideas to the table.
 - Patreon, for the immense success you've had with recurring payments, turning donations into sustainable income for creators.
 - Bitcoin, for bringing cryptocurrency to the world, enabling Thankful to work well.
