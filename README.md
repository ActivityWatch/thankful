# Thankful

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SuperuserLabs/thankful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SuperuserLabs/thankful)

_Support creators of free culture the way you want. Be thankful._

Thankful is an app that keeps track of the websites you visit, the videos you watch, the music you listen to (not yet), which applications you use (such as Thankful itself) and then tries to figure out who created it so that you can choose to easily support those you find deserving, by directly sending them cryptocurrency.

This helps solve a fundamental issue on the internet, where most culture is created and consumed today, where creators often have a larger incentive to simply get your attention as long as possible rather than to try and provide you with something of value. By using Thankful, you incentivize creators to not only spend more time and effort on what they do best, but to make sure that the content they create is **worth supporting**.

Thankful is being developed by Superuser Labs. It is our hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have more healthier incentives on the internet.

- Decentralized
- No special token
- No forced fees (but we hope you will be thankful and support our continued work!)

### Feature wishlist

These are things we haven't built yet, but are figuring out.

- Let you donate to creators who you don't yet know the cryptocurrency address (or who might not even have a wallet).
  - This helps greatly with virality and cryptocurrency adoption, see [issue #164](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/164).
  - See our [smart contracts](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful-contracts) for more info.
- Allow for donations with ERC-20 tokens, especially stablecoins like Dai.
- Reward supporters with "tokens of gratitude" (proofs of support).
- Keep track of the amount that creators have received.
- Enable creators to give back to their supporters.
- Import data from [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch).
  - Lets users support creators of non-web apps/software, music, and more.

## What content can currently be funded by Thankful?

We want to make it possible to easily support all creators. These are the things we've been thinking about:

- Videos
  - From YouTube
- Music
  - From YouTube
- Writing
  - From Medium
- Patreon (lol)

### Platforms we want to support in the future

- Music
  - Spotify ([issue #175](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/175))
  - Soundcloud ([issue #15](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/15))
- Personal websites/blogs, social media posts and comments
- Podcasts
- Software
  - Funding development of free software has been a problem for a long time (See this [aptly titled article](https://fosspost.org/opinions/people-be-thankful-for-free-software-developers))
  - Software creator could choose to support development of important dependencies.
- Charities
  - While not creating content, we believe charity aligns well with the design of Thankful, and hope to be able to make it easy for users to support highly effective like the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) and [Effective Altruism Funds](https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds).

## Alternatives

We've kept an eye on all the alternatives in the space (there are a lot of great ideas out there) and collected them here so people can compare us to the alternatives themselves.

- Patreon
- Kickstarter
- Open Collective
- Bountysource
- Flattr
- Gratipay
- Liberapay
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Giveth](https://giveth.io/)
- [Bitbacker](https://bitbacker.io/)
- [Donaid](https://donaid.io/)

All these deserve our deepest thanks; they have all done something special and we've learned a lot from them.

Here's a related article by the FOSSPost: ["Fund Open Source Software With These 5 Platforms"](https://fosspost.org/articles/fund-open-source-software-with-these-5-platforms)

<!-- These all have different niches filled in different ways, it'd be nice to write about what they do well for their niche, and how that could be generalized, or how we compare -->
