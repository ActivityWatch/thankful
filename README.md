Thankful
========

*Reward the creators of content and software according to your preferences. Be thankful.*

Thankful is a program that takes data about which websites you visit, which music you listen to, which videos you watch, which applications you use (such as Thankful itself), and then presents it to you and allows you to allocate a charitable sum of your choice to those creators you think are deserving.

By using Thankful, you incentivize people to want you to like what they are doing, instead of exploiting or distracting you (such as advertising, sponsored content and data collection).

Thankful is a planned project of the ActivityWatch team, it is our hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have more sane incentives in society.

## Features

 - Supports data from ActivityWatch
