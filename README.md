# Thankful

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SuperuserLabs/thankful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SuperuserLabs/thankful)

_Support free culture by automatically sending cryptocurrency to the creators of the content you love._

Thankful is an app that keeps track of the websites you visit, the videos you watch, the music you listen to (not yet), which applications you use (such as Thankful itself) and then tries to figure out who created it so that you can choose to easily support those you find deserving, by directly sending them cryptocurrency.

This helps solve a fundamental issue on the internet where ad-funded creators have incentive to steal your attention as long as possible instead of providing you with as much value as they can. By using Thankful, you incentivize creators to spend more time and effort on creating **what you want**, and reward those who do.

Thankful is being developed by Superuser Labs. We hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have healthier incentives on the internet.

- No forced fees (but we hope you will be thankful and support our continued work!)

### Feature wishlist

These are things we haven't built yet, but are figuring out.

- Let you donate to creators who you don't yet know the cryptocurrency address (or who might not even have a wallet).
  - This helps greatly with virality and cryptocurrency adoption, see [issue #164](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/164).
  - See our [smart contracts](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful-contracts) for more info.
- Allow for donations with ERC-20 tokens, especially stablecoins like Dai.
- Reward supporters with "tokens of gratitude" (proofs of support).
- Keep track of the amount that creators have received.
- Enable creators to give back to their supporters.
- Import data from [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch).
  - Lets users support creators of non-web apps/software, music, and more.

## What content can currently be funded by Thankful?

We want to make it easy to support creators on all platforms and mediums. These are the things we're currently supporting:

- **Videos**: on YouTube
- **Code**: on GitHub
- **Writing**: on Medium

### Things we want to support in the future

- Music
  - Spotify ([issue #175](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/175))
  - Soundcloud ([issue #15](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/issues/15))
  - Last.fm
- Personal websites/blogs, social media posts and comments
- Podcasts
- Software
  - Funding development of free software has been a problem for a long time (See this [aptly titled article](https://fosspost.org/opinions/people-be-thankful-for-free-software-developers))
  - Software creator could choose to support development of important dependencies.
- Other types of activity that can be gathered by [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net)
- Charities
  - While not creating content, we believe charity aligns well with the design of Thankful, and hope to be able to make it easy for users to support highly effective like the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) and [Effective Altruism Funds](https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds).

<!-- These all have different niches filled in different ways, it'd be nice to write about what they do well for their niche, and how that could be generalized, or how we compare -->
