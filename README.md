Thankful
========

*Reward the creators of all content and software according to your preferences. Be thankful.*

Thankful is a program that takes data about which websites you visit, which music you listen to, which videos you watch, which applications you use (such as Thankful itself), and then presents it to you and allows you to distribute a charitable sum of your choice to those creators you think are deserving.

By using Thankful, you incentivize people to want you to like what they are doing, instead of exploiting or distracting you (such as advertising, sponsored content and data collection).

Thankful is a planned project of the ActivityWatch team, it is our hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have more sane incentives in society.

## Features

 - Supports data from ActivityWatch.
 - Reward content primarily to creators, not platforms.
 - Payments are done using cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin), allowing for both anonymous and provable donations.
 - As a way to incentivize creators to be transparent about the donations they have received.
   - Could be used to build a list of top creators, effectively providing exposure for the most appreciated and high quality content.
   - Could be used as a score in a personal recommendation engine (I'm thinking a lot about this right now).

## What content could be funded by Thankful?

 - Videos (from web/YouTube/Vimeo history)
 - Music (from Spotify/Soundcloud history)
 - Writing (from web history)
 - Software (from application usage)
   - How the development of free software should be funded has been a problem for a long time (See [this article](https://fosspost.org/opinions/people-be-thankful-for-free-software-developers))
   - We could even fund development of the software dependencies by doing dependency analysis. Preferably the software creator would indicate which dependencies are important enough to receive a part of the funds.

## How do creators join?

This is an issue where we have yet to decide on a solution. We don't want a centralized control, because we don't think it should be necessary. we have no interest in making a inferior solution just to make some money ourselves. We can not afford to make compromises in succeeding.

Some options are:

 - Website owners put a special tag in place which provides a cryptocurrency address for receiving donations.
 - Content creators on platforms are identified automatically and looked up in a database.
 - Users of Thankful can themselves look up a donation method when one is not automatically detected.

## Uses

 - Anyone can become a creator and be funded without a third party.
 - Transparent donation methods (such as cryptocurrencies) give users an insight into how much creators make.
 - By being able to prove your charity you can prove your goodwill.

## What does it cost?

Zero, zip, nothing, nil. We will try to make Thankful as good as possible and hope that people will be thankful for that and reward us accordingly. In essence, we want to prove that it works by funding ourselves with it.

## Thank you

 - Patreon, for the immense success you've had with recurring payments, turning donations into sustainable income for creators.
 - Flattr and Flattr Plus, for bringing some good ideas to the table (but unfortunately failing to care about privacy).
 - Steem, a pretty cool experiment. We've learned a lot by observing it.
 - Yours (see video here by Ryan Charles: ["Improving Content Quality with P2P Micropayments"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtYJ748LA1M))
 - Bitcoin, for bringing cryptocurrency to the world, enabling Thankful to work well.
